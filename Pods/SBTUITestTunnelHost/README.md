## Overview

Apple's UI testing framework is a tremendously powerful tool to write ui tests for your application. There are however some edge cases were tests can become difficult/impossible to write. We've been developing this tool to cover different (at first sight unrelated) needs in our ui testing workflow.

SBTUITestTunnelHost includes a Mac App (Server) and a set of classes to be used in your UI test target which enables to:

- launch shell commands on the Mac host from within the test target. This can come in handy if you have shell scripts that interact with your backend environment (user creation, deletion, content modification and so on)
- perform mouse actions. We use this to perform very fast interaction (i.e. very fast and repeated swipes) with the app under test, which is not possible using XCTest capabilities
- serve static content file. Lift you from installing a full web server when in need to serve simple static content

## Installation (CocoaPods)

We strongly suggest to use [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) being the easiest way to embed the library inside your project. You simply need to add `SBTUITestTunnelHost` to your UI Test target. 

## Installation (Manual)

Add files in the *SBTUITestTunnelHost* to the UI test target.

## Usage

### Mac

Launch the Mac App (either by compiling the `Mac Host/SBTUITunnelHostServer.xcworkspace` or launching the executable in `Mac Host/Binary/SBTUITestTunnelServer.zip`) which will fire a server on your local machine on port 8667. The current status of the server will be shown in the macOS menubar.

#### Security Warnings ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ 

The tool is intended for testing enviornments only, use with care since **it allows to access and execute commands** on the running host. **Make sure that the host is only reachable by trusted clients.**

To increase security by default the application binds the server to localhost. This means that it will only receive requests from within the same machine that runs the tool, which should be fine in most cases. You can optionally launch the application  passing the `--skipLocalhostBinding` or by manually toggling the option from menubar to bypass this limitation.

For additional security launch the tool with a system user with [specific access privileges](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US&amp;viewlocale=en_US)

### UI Tests

In your code just import SBTUITestTunnelHost. This will add a `host` property to the XCTest class which is an instance of `SBTUITestTunnelHost`.

The Example project comes with several Tests in Swift and Objective-C that show the different use cases.

#### launching shell commands
To remotely execute a command invoke  `host.executeCommand(cmd)` which will synchronously execute the command and return the stdout output.

#### mouse actions: Clicks
Create an instance of `SBTUITunneledHostMouseClick` by passing the `XCUIElement` you want to be clicked (center of element will be clicked) and specifying a delay, in seconds, to wait after the click has been performed. This is useful if you need to create a sequence of `[SBTUITunneledHostMouseClick]`.

This will execute 3 consecutive mouse clicks on element `btn` with a pause of 50ms in between
```
let mouseClick = SBTUITunneledHostMouseClick(element: btn, completionPause: 0.05)
let mouseCliks = Array(repeating: mouseClick, count: 3)
host.execute(mouseCliks)
```

#### mouse actions: Drags
Create an instance of `SBTUITunneledHostMouseDrag` by passing the `XCUIElement` you want to be dragged.
Additionally you have to pass normalized coordinates (values between 0.0 and 1.0) of the start and stop points of the drag. (0.0, 0.0) represents top left corner, (1.0, 1.0) bottom right.
As for clicks you specify a delay, in seconds, to wait after the drag has been performed.

This will execute 3 consecutive mouse drags (swipe ups) on element `table` with a duration of 100ms and a pause of 50ms in between
```
let mouseDrag = SBTUITunneledHostMouseDrag(element: table,
                                           startNormalizedPoint: CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.9),
                                           stopNormalizedPoint: CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.1),
                                           dragDuration: 0.1,
                                           completionPause: 0.05)
let mouseDrags = Array(repeating: mouseDrag, count: 3)
host.execute(mouseDrags)
```

The result is a much faster scrolling as can be seen from the demo below.
